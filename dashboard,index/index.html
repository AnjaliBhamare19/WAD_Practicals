                        The institute has been a pioneer in Post Graduation of Computer Engineering (M.E.) among the un-aided Engineering Colleges 
                        affiliated to SPPU since the year 2000. Subsequently, the Post-Graduate (PG) programmes in Computer Engineering, Data Science, 
                        Electronics & Communication (Wireless Communication Technology), and Information Technology were added. PICT is also a Savitribai 
                        Phule Pune University (SPPU) recognized Research Center in Computer Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering.

                        Taking into account, the ever-increasing demand for Computer Engineers, globally, PICT started the Bachelor 
                        of Engineering (B.E.) programme in Computer Engineering with affiliation to University of Pune (now Savitribai 
                        Phule Pune University (SPPU)). PICT is the first self-financed institute to start a Computer Engineering (B.E.) 
                        programme in Maharashtra, with an intake capacity of 60 which was subsequently increased to 120 in the Academic 
                        Year (A.Y.) 1984-85, and at present, is 240. In the year 1995, considering the rapid growth in the electronic industry 
                        and the huge demand for competent engineers, the institute started Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering (B.E.), 
                        programme with an intake of 60, and at present, it is 240. In A.Y. 2001-02, the Information Technology (B.E.) programme 
                        was started to meet the requirements of the booming IT industry, with an intake of 60, which is now 180.

                         During the 1980s, as the computer revolution was sweeping the world, empowering ambitious 
                         professionals to bring their dreams to reality, Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) 
                         was established in 1983 under the aegis of Society for Computer Technology and Research (SCTR) 
                         by noble personalities namely, Shri. Gopal Krishna, Shri. N. Ramakrishna, and Shri. R. S. Kothavale. 
                         The goal of the great visionaries was to make PICT the leader in higher technical education and research 
                         and thereby contribute towards the growth of the organization and society at large by attracting and sustaining 
                         gifted individuals who have enormous potential.
