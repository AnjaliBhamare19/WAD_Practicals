                <p class="p-3 m-4">Irani Cafe was founded by the joy of cooking and serving, by two cousins, Mr. Reza and Mr. Kasem.
                    As a child, Reza would always head to the bakery 'bhatti' and take great interest in the making of products, and what went on behind the intricate Iranian designs of the walls. After completing his masters from New Castle University, Kasem was keen to come back home and pursue his calling.
                    <br>
                    "Hospitality has always been in our blood. Our forefathers migrated to India and since inception, got into the business of running cafes. Serving refreshing tea and bakery items was their forte. This kept passing from generation to generation and we had the inspiration in us to start a new age Irani Cafe. Thus, the idea was born in 2016."
                    <br>
                    Irani Cafe is a tasty tribute to the vanishing establishment of bun, broon and Bentwood chairs, with a bill to match an era gone by. In the early days, Kasem and Reza would begin their day at 5:00 in the morning, head to the bakery and ensure the buns would reach in time for the cafe to open at 6:00.                </p>
