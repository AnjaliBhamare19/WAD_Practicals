                Beets are loaded with vitamins and minerals yet low in calories
                and fat. They're also a good source of several key nutrients,
                including folate, manganese, and copper. Packed with nutrition,
                beets have antioxidants like betalains that fight cell damage
                and inflammation, potentially offering protection against cancer
                and heart disease. Health benefits of beets include more stamina
                during exercise, heart disease and stroke prevention, and lower
                blood pressure.

          <p>
            Carrot Alternaria and Cercospora Leaf Blights are common fungal
            diseases of carrot leaves and petioles. While neither disease
            directly hurts the carrot root, yield loss occurs when petioles
            become so brittle that they break off during mechanical harvest
            leaving the carrot in the ground. In warm, moist weather, Alternaria
            leaf spots develop rapidly so that the entire field may appear to
            have been injured by frost or chemicals. Crop loss will be more
            severe when plants become infected early in the season.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alternaria and Cercospora are difficult to distinguish in the field
            and often appear on the same plant. The principle difference
            involves disease timing. Cercospora leaf blight, caused by the
            fungus Cercospora carotae, attacks young rapidly growing plants;
            Alternaria leaf blight, caused by the fungus Alternaria dauci,
            primarily attacks older plants, although seedlings may also be
            infected.
