        During the 1980s, as the computer revolution was sweeping the world, empowering ambitious professionals to 
        bring their dreams to reality, Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) was established in 1983 under the 
        aegis of Society for Computer Technology and Research (SCTR) by noble personalities namely, Shri. Gopal Krishna, 
        Shri. N. Ramakrishna, and Shri. R. S. Kothavale. The goal of the great visionaries was to make PICT the leader in 
        higher technical education and research and thereby contribute towards the growth of the organization and society at 
        large by attracting and sustaining gifted individuals who have enormous potential.
       </p>

       <p>
        Taking into account, the ever-increasing demand for Computer Engineers, globally, <a href="https://pict.edu/">PICT</a> started the Bachelor of Engineering 
        (B.E.) programme in Computer Engineering with affiliation to University of Pune (now Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)). <br>
         PICT is the first self-financed institute to start a Computer Engineering (B.E.) programme in Maharashtra, with an intake capacity 
         of 60 which was subsequently increased to 120 in the Academic Year (A.Y.) 1984-85, and at present, is 240. In the year 1995, considering 
         the rapid growth in the electronic industry and the huge demand for competent engineers, the institute started Electronics & Telecommunication 
         Engineering (B.E.), programme with an intake of 60, and at present, it is 240. In A.Y. 2001-02, the Information Technology (B.E.) programme was 
         started to meet the requirements of the booming IT industry, with an intake of 60, which is now 180.
       </p>

       <p>
        The institute has been a pioneer in Post Graduation of Computer Engineering (M.E.) among the un-aided Engineering Colleges affiliated to SPPU 
        since the year 2000. Subsequently, the Post-Graduate (PG) programmes in Computer Engineering, Data Science, Electronics & Communication (Wireless 
        Communication Technology), and Information Technology were added. PICT is also a Savitribai Phule
         Pune University (SPPU) recognized Research Center in Computer Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering.
